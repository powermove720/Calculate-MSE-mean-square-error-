# Calculate-MSE-mean-square-error
VB.NET function to calculate MSE (mean square error).

VB.NET Function: CalculateMSE

This function calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE), a common statistical metric used to measure the average squared difference between predicted values and actual values. It is frequently employed in the evaluation of regression models and other predictive algorithms.

# Functionality
Purpose: The primary goal of this function is to compute the MSE between two arrays of double-precision floating-point numbers representing predicted and actual values, respectively.

# Input Validation:

Array Length Check: It verifies that both input arrays have the same length, as calculating MSE requires a one-to-one correspondence between predicted and actual values.

Numeric Value Check: It rigorously checks if all elements within both arrays are valid numeric values, ensuring that they are neither NaN (Not a Number) nor Infinity.


# MSE Calculation:

Squared Error Calculation: For each pair of corresponding predicted and actual values, it computes the squared difference.

Accumulation: It accumulates the squared differences.

Mean Calculation: Finally, it divides the accumulated sum of squared differences by the number of data points (the length of the arrays) to obtain the Mean Squared Error.


# Usage

VB.Net
Dim predictedValues As Double() = {2.5, 3.8, 1.2, 4.9}
Dim actualValues As Double() = {3.0, 4.2, 1.5, 5.1}

Dim mse As Double = CalculateMSE(predictedValues, actualValues)
Console.WriteLine("Mean Squared Error (MSE): " & mse) 

# Error Handling

ArgumentException: If the input arrays have different lengths or contain non-numeric values (NaN or Infinity), the function throws an ArgumentException with a descriptive error message.

# Considerations

Optimization: The function is optimized for performance by iterating through the input arrays only once and utilizing short-circuiting logic (AndAlso) to efficiently check for numeric validity.

Numerical Stability: In scenarios where the MSE calculation might lead to extremely large numbers, consider using data scaling or normalization techniques to mitigate the risk of potential numerical overflow.
